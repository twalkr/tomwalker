# tomwalker README

![](https://cdn.zapier.com/storage/files/26a34a18dcb798482052d2440716d001.mp4) | I've put this document together to help you understand how I operate, and what makes me tick as a human being & a manager. I'm committed to getting to know you personally though, and so this README isn't intended to replace the precious time we'll have getting to know one another.

It's a living document, and so if you find something you don't agree with - please do call it out by sending me a Slack DM. It's likely that I've either changed my mind, or I need a nudge to remind me about a commitment I've set.

## Why Support? Why Zapier?

When a Customer Champion role came up at Zapier I had absolutely no intention of leaving my existing role, but after some research I fell in love with Zapier's values, culture & the idea of remote working. I knew that I had to apply and so I took the leap of faith and submitted an application. After all, what can be more fulfilling than working for an organisation committed to the values that I live by anyway, and in a workplace where diversity & inclusion is valued so highly?

I started out in the Customer Champion role in September 2018, moving to Premier Support as an inaugural member in February 2019 and then became a Senior Customer Champion in August 2019. When a Team Lead  Before Zapier, I worked for 2 years at Capsule CRM in their support team - and prior to that I survived 7 years at Apple Retail working in a number of roles from sales to training to repairs. 

## How I'll help you

The reason I get out of bed every morning is the desire and passion to _help people succeed_; whether that's a customer spending thousands of dollars a month with us, or helping unblock one of my team to work on a project that helps the team succeed. I truly believe that when we work together, as a direct and manager, or as a team, we'll achieve our best work.

Through candid conversation, coaching & feedback I hope that I'll help you succeed in your goals and ambitions.

## How you can help me

I'm still learning and understanding what it's like to be a manager, and so during this crucial phase I invite you to be as candid as you feel you can with me. I am used to (and enjoy!) having my work reviewed and I am very receptive to feedback - no matter how positive or negative. I know that it can be super scary to share negative feedback, and I always keep that in mind when I'm approached with feedback. Believe me, I know all too well what that feeling in your stomach is like! I urge you to share the feedback regardless of that feeling, and I assure you that I'll appreciate it.

## Communication Approach

I've been told before that I can be quite blunt in the way I communicate, and that I have a hang of 'telling it how it is'. I don't disagree with either of those - but if you don't like to be communicated to like that, please let me know and I can adjust my style. 

I treat Slack as an asynchronous communication tool, and so when I send you a message I don't expect an immediate reply - especially if it's outside of your working hours. If I need to communicate with you in sync, I'll ask if you're available for that via Slack - or spin up a Zoom call with your permission. That goes both ways, and if you'd like to chat about something in sync please let me know.

## My shortcomings

Some feedback I've had in the past is that some folk don't quite know how to take me, and that it come across like I don't like them. I'm very certain that's because I can be quite aloof, especially where I struggle to find to find common ground with people. This is something I've seen in myself, and I can definitely see why I'd come across like this. If you feel the same, please don't take it personally - but please do find the courage to tell me if you can. I'm trying to get better at identifying this myself, and making more of an effort to build relationships where I feel this is the case.
